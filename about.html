    <h2>About Supper Coffee</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Welcome to Supper Coffee, a warm and welcoming coffee shop created for everyone who believes that a good day always starts with a great cup of coffee. At Supper Coffee, we blend passion, flavor, and comfort to offer you an unforgettable coffee experience.</p>
        <li>Our Story</li>
        <p>Supper Coffee was founded with one simple idea — to bring people together through the love of coffee. We started as a small neighborhood café with a big dream: to serve freshly brewed, high-quality coffee in a cozy and friendly environment. Over time, we’ve become a favorite destination for students, professionals, and families who love to relax, chat, or work while enjoying their favorite drink.</p>
        <li>What Makes Us Special</li>
        <p>At Supper Coffee, we take pride in every detail. Our premium coffee beans are handpicked from trusted farmers who share our commitment to quality and sustainability. Each bean is roasted to perfection, ensuring a smooth and rich taste in every sip. Our skilled baristas carefully craft every cup, from classic espresso to creamy lattes, refreshing cold brews, and our signature special drinks that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
        <p>We also care about our community and the environment. That’s why we focus on eco-friendly practices, such as using biodegradable cups and supporting local suppliers.</p>
        <li>More Than Just Coffee</li>
        <p>We believe that coffee tastes best when paired with something delicious. That’s why we offer a variety of freshly baked pastries, sandwiches, and desserts, all made daily in our kitchen. Whether you crave a chocolate muffin, a crispy croissant, or a healthy smoothie, there’s something here for everyone.</p>
